Prevent the Meal Class from allowing multiples of the SAME item from being added to it.

There should be limits for Toppings (ex: pickles x1 or extra pickles x2 allowed, but not pickles x3, pickles x4, etc.)

Prevent the bread, meat, side, topping and meal classes from being instantiated or modified in the Main.main() method. The only class that should be instantiated is the order class. ///everything but the meal class is done but my Main is doing the job of what Order is supposed to (aka encapsulating the rest of the classes). I think it will be alot of work to fix this, I will probably leave as is

should only allow "healthy" topping choices (no bacon, no cheese, etc.)
// will add boolean field to Toppings and then HealthyBurger type will only be able to add if the topping boolean is True.
