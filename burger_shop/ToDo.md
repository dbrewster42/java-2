1. Prevent the Meal Class from allowing multiples of the SAME item from being added to it.
//will put if statement inside the addSide() method of Meal, checking to see if side already exists(other items already done)

2. There should be limits for Toppings (ex: pickles x1 or extra pickles x2 allowed, but not pickles x3, pickles x4, etc.)
///every time I add a topping I will have to loop through the ArrayList of existing toppings and see if it exists, then if it does, I will have to start an inner loop and make sure it doesn't exist a second time.
